Pepipost API SDK-Python
=================
This is the official Pepipost SDK for Python. 

This SDK was semi-automatically generated by APIMATIC v2.0. Thanks to [APIMATIC](http://apimatic.io/)

This SDK uses the Requests library and will work for Python 2.6 â€” 3.5.

INSTALLATION: 
=============
The generated code uses Python libraries named Requests and Jsonpickle. 

PIP is a popular tool for managing python packages[1].

To resolve these packages:

1) From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory

2) Invoke 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Note: You will need internet access to resolve these dependencies.

USAGE:
===========

```python
from PepipostAPIV10Lib.Controllers.Email import *
import json

controller = Email()

#data = ()
data = { 
    'api_key' : 'yoursecretapikey',
    'recipients' : ['recipient1@example.com','recipient2@example.com'],
    'email_details' : { 
        'fromname' : 'sender name',
        'subject' : 'test email subject sent using Pepipost SDK - Python',
        'from' : 'from@example.com',
        'content' : '<p>This is a test email sent using Pepipost JSON/Email Python SDK</p>'
    }   
}

response = controller.send(data)

print response
```
